## Project Title: 

#### Big Data Inspection - NYC Food Scrap Drop Off Location Analysis
 
## Project Description:

###### The main purpose of this project is to analyze the dataset which contains information about the food scrap drop off location in NYC and perform verious operations to understand the data. 

## ETL Process:

The food scrap drop off location is given for NYC boroughs and from the dataset using the latitude and longitude values, I am planning to pull the reviews and ratings for each location using google places API. The google places API requires placeid as parameter which will be extracted from google geocoding API first, then the placeid will be passed to places API for extracting reviews and ratings.

#### Google Geocoding API

    https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?latlng=40.714224,-73.961452&key=YOUR_API_KEY

#### Google Places API

    https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/details/json?place_id=ChIJN1t_tDeuEmsRUsoyG83frY4&fields=name,rating,formatted_phone_number&key=YOUR_API_KEY
