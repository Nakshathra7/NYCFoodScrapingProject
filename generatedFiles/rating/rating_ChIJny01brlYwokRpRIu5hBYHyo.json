            "text" : "This was my first time getting a wax at this location. I decided to try EWC based on a recommendation from a friend. This was the second time I’ve gotten a wax in general. The service was okay the esthetician was pretty cool but the entire experience was rushed. There was an option to choose different waxes online but when I got there they said there was only one. I was told that the specialize in speed waxing and in such a case every session is only 15 minutes. I didn’t like this at all. I had lots of questions and felt like I was pressured to just lay down. Then she explained the difference about their wax while she was applying it which meant I couldn’t decline the service.  Overall my wax was pretty good she made sure she cleaned the area and oiled the are well. I’m glad that she discussed aftercare and taking care of the skin. This is was very important to me. She also recommended some products that they sold in location. They also put emphasis on coming late and automatically book your next appointment like they are a doctors appointment. I think will be visiting again.",

Luckily I was able to go straight from there to a walk-in at Bespoke Brows which was way better, nicer, cuter vibe, and better brows! I'd highly recommend them instead as they are totally chill :)",
